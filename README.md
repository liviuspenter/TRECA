# TRECA
TCR Read Extraction and Cytokine Analysis for plate-based single T cell receptor sequencing generated by a protocol originally described in 
[Han et al., Nature Biotechnology 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2938).

This repository provides capabilities for extraction of TCR sequences and cytokine / transcription factor data
based on IMGT, CD-HIT, MUSCLE, and BLAST.
